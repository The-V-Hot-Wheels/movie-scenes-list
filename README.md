This is just a quick and dirty way to figure out what we need to put in the JSON 
files.

After a lot of headache searching Google for a simple solution to the CORS

temporarily disabling the file URI strict origin policy immediately before I 
work on this part of the project, and restoring it after I quit for the day.
